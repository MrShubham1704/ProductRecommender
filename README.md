## The **Recommendation System** program is a Java-based application that suggests products to users based on their preferences using **Apache Mahout**. It utilizes **collaborative filtering** to analyze user-product interactions and generate personalized recommendations.  

The program loads a dataset from a CSV file containing user ratings for various products. It employs the **Pearson Correlation Similarity** algorithm to measure the similarity between users and identifies a neighborhood using the **NearestNUserNeighborhood** method. Based on this, a **GenericUserBasedRecommender** generates recommendations for a specific user.  

The program outputs a list of recommended product IDs along with their scores, indicating the strength of the recommendation. Additionally, a dummy evaluation score is displayed to represent the systemâ€™s accuracy.  

This project is ideal for e-commerce, streaming platforms, and content-based applications where personalized suggestions enhance user experience. The implementation follows a structured approach, making it easy to extend for real-world applications.
